### Challenge: Database relations [e-commerce starting point] :rocket:

Application developed in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html). It includes the use of a database with [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/) and ManyToMany relationships.
It's a starting point for a simple e-commerce system and allows the creation of customers, products and orders. The customer can generate new purchase orders.

### Running Locally

:warning: Add a database named `gostack_desafio09` before running migrations.

```sh
# install packages
yarn

# run server and start app
yarn dev:server
```
